My first attempt at creating an app with Compose. 
The idea is simple - a primitive chat for two interlocutors with authorization. Firebase is used as the remote database. During the development process, a news screen was added for working with the API and Room.
The navigation logic and news loading logic are shown in the diagrams in Figma: [Logic diagrams](https://www.figma.com/file/8WbVt1cdh7tux2IYcdDMNR/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=C0pntR3b8efcUr26-0)
